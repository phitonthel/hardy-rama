    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;">In mathematics, the nth taxicab number, typically denoted Ta(n) or Taxicab(n), also called the nth Hardyâ€“Ramanujan number, is defined as the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two positive integer cubes in n distinct ways. The most famous taxicab number is 1729 = Ta(2) = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103.</p>

    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;">The name is derived from a conversation in about 1919 involving mathematicians G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan. As told by Hardy:</p>
      
    <p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;"><i>I remember once going to see him [Ramanujan] when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi-cab No. 1729, and remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two different ways."</i></p>
